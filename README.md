  <p>The <b>Rocklin Performing Arts and Cultural Center</b> is a project proposed by Roger S. Peterson to provide a relaxing venue for the citizens of Rocklin to enjoy all of their cultural interests. With the help of my team, I created this website to give Mr. Peterson a means of proposing his idea to the Rocklin city board and ultimately the people of the city of Rocklin.

## The story behind this project
As the leader of the Web Development club at Rocklin High School, I was tasked by Roger S. Peterson (a member of the city of Rocklin, California) to bring his idea of building a **Rocklin Performing Arts and Cultural Center** to life. He needed a website where he could organize his ideas, present them to the city board, and ultimately advertise his idea to the general public. With the help of the members of my club, we worked closely with Mr. Peterson to create a website that fulfilled his needs and after nearly a year of work we launched [rocklinpacc.org](https://rocklinpacc.org)!

## Technologies
This was my first big web development project created back in 2019! For the sake of simplicity (and to make up for our lack of web programming knowledge), my team chose Wordpress as our development platform. We designed the site from scratch using the Divi builder plugin.
