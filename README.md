  <b>The Rocklin Performing Arts & Cultural Center</b> is a project proposed by the Rocklin city council to provide a relaxing venue for the citizens of Rocklin to enjoy all of their cultural interests. Not just plays and musicals, but also art exhibits, informative presentations, and even culinary arts. We envision a multi-purpose facility for everyone, young and old, that reflects all of Placer County.

## The story behind this project
As the leader of the Web Development club at Rocklin High School, I was tasked by Roger S. Peterson (a member of the city of Rocklin) to bring his idea of building a **Rocklin Performing Arts and Cultural Center** to life. He needed a website where he could organize his ideas, present them to the city board, and ultimately advertise his idea to the general public. With the help of the members of my club, we worked closely with Mr. Peterson to create a website that fulfilled his needs and after nearly a year of work we launched [rocklinpacc.org](https://rocklinpacc.org)!

## Technologies
This was my first big web development project and for the sake of simplicity my team chose Wordpress as our development platform. We designed the site from scratch using the Divi builder plugin.
